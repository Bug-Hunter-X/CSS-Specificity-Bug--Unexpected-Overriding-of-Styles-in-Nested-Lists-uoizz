To resolve this issue, we must ensure that the desired styles are applied with the correct specificity.  We can achieve this by adjusting the order or specificity of selectors.

One solution is to use more specific selectors or to increase the specificity of the selectors that need to be applied.

```css
nav ul {
  list-style: none;
}

nav li {
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 10px;
  background-color: #f0f0f0; /* Apply background color here */
}
```

By applying the background color directly to `nav li`, we ensure it is applied regardless of any nested selectors with higher specificity.  Alternatively, we could use a class to target elements for enhanced control and avoid these specificity issues.
