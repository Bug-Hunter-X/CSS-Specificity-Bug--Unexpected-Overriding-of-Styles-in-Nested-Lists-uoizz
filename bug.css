The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors.  The intention is to style all list items within a navigation bar, but due to incorrect nesting and specificity, the expected styles are not applied.

```css
nav ul {
  list-style: none;
}

nav li {
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 10px;
}

nav ul li {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
```

The `nav ul li` selector has higher specificity than `nav li`, unintentionally overriding the `display: inline-block` style. This is less common because the selectors are usually more complex, involving classes or IDs.
